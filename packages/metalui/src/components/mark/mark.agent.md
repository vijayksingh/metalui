# Mark

Recognition made visible on the text. React: `Mark`, `MarkUrl`, `MarkInferred`, `MarkUrgency`, `MarkLife` from `@unlocalhosted/metalui` (earlier `Cue`, `CueUrl`, `MarkInferred`, `CueUrgency`, `CueLife`); the checkbox is `Checkbox`. SwiftUI: `Text.metalMark(_:colorway:)`, `MetalMarkTag`, `MetalMarkURLPill`, `MetalMarkInferred`, `MetalMarkUrgency`, `MetalMarkLife`.

## Use it for

- Marking what a recognizer understood in a person's own writing: a date, a duration, an amount, a measurement, a tag, a colour, a link.
- A task's checkbox in the margin (`Checkbox`), a task the model inferred (`Checkbox ghost`), and urgency (`MarkUrgency`).
- The one life glyph trailing a block (`MarkLife` around a `Life*Icon` at 16).

## Don't use it for

- Changing the text. A cue never rewrites, reflows or recolours the words (tags are ink2, derived tags ink3, never a hue).
- Anything the person did not write: a value the model read that is not in the text is a `MarkInferred` pill after the words, never an underline.
- Status, errors or calls to action. Cues are quiet and have no toast, badge or sound.

## Anatomy

| Cue | Rest | While writing |
|---|---|---|
| date | dotted underline green .7, 1.5 thick, offset 3.5; hover chip with the resolved date | same |
| duration · amount | solid quiet underline 1, offset 3.5 (the text's own figures: tabular digits would change the advance) | same |
| measurement | solid green .42 underline 1.5, offset 4 | same |
| tag | soft pill: padding 1/4 paid back by margin 0/−4, ink2 | same |
| derived tag | hollow pill (.5 ring), ink3 | same |
| hex | 3 pt underline in the colour at 78 %, skip-ink off; the 11 pt swatch before it at rest | underline only |
| match | a search's matched words in a result row: weight 650, a green .55 underline 1.5 thick, offset 2.5 (heavier, so result rows only, never writing) | never |
| URL | a 20 tall host pill with the link glyph at 11 | the raw URL, plain |
| inferred | a 17 tall hollow pill in the label role after the last word | hidden |
| dimple | 16 pt well, radius 6, hanging at −25 in the gutter; checked: dark with a white tick | the raw `[ ] ` sits in the gutter |
| ghost dimple | 14 pt hollow, radius 5; the band grows left by 36 instead of indenting the words | hidden |
| urgency | 5 pt amber LED at −35 | hidden |
| life glyph | after a middle dot, 16 tuned cut, ink3 → ink2 on the host's hover, tint for feelings | hidden |

## Motion

The resolved-value chip rises 3 pt on the part spring (instant under Reduce Motion). The dimple's tick draws on in 220 ms after a 40 ms beat on an ease-out, not sprung (DS-21); instant under Reduce Motion. The life glyph fades in 120 ms when recognised; its hover is the glyph's own. Nothing else moves.

## API

```tsx
import { Cue, CueUrl, CueInferred, CueLife, Dimple, CueUrgency } from '@unlocalhosted/metalui';
import { LinkIcon } from '@unlocalhosted/metalui/icons';
import { LifeCoffeeIcon } from '@unlocalhosted/metalui/icons/life';

<Dimple checked={done} onCheckedChange={tick} aria-label="Poster task" />
Send the poster <Cue kind="date" resolved="TUE 30 SEP · 16:00">tomorrow 4pm</Cue> for <Cue kind="tag">#poster</Cue>
<CueUrl host="figma.com" href={url} glyph={<LinkIcon size={11} />} />
<CueInferred resolved="FRI 3 OCT · RECOGNIZER 0.82">fri</CueInferred>
<CueLife><LifeCoffeeIcon size={16} /></CueLife>
```

| Component | Props |
|---|---|
| `Cue` | `kind` (`date`, `duration`, `amount`, `measurement`, `tag`, `derived-tag`, `hex`), `resolved` (hover chip), `color` and `swatch` (hex) |
| `CueUrl` | `host`, `glyph`, any anchor attribute |
| `MarkInferred` | `resolved` |
| `Dimple` | Base UI Checkbox props (`checked`, `onCheckedChange`, `disabled`), `doing`, `ghost` |
| `CueUrgency` | – |
| `CueLife` | the glyph as children |

## Rules

- Metric-neutral: every in-flow cue has the same advance as the plain text it marks (measured width delta 0.00 pt). Never add padding without paying it back.
- One life glyph per block, trailing; never a chip for a glyph; never while writing.
- Ticking a dimple is a person's action: the host writes `[x]` into the text and offers Undo. Applying a cue never rewrites text.
- Hidden confidence is a bug: an inferred value shows where it came from (`RECOGNIZER 0.82`) in its chip.

## Accessibility

- The dimple is a real checkbox (Base UI): Space toggles it, it has a focus ring, and `doing` is announced as mixed. Give it a label that names the task.
- The resolved-value chip also shows on keyboard focus. The hover chip repeats what the text already says, so it is not the only carrier.
- The URL pill is a link with its host as its name; the urgency LED has the label "Due soon".
- Colour is never the only cue: underline patterns differ (dotted date, solid values), and tags are shapes.
