# Selection frame

the object sheet: the one selection for every kind of object. React: `SelectionFrame` from `@unlocalhosted/metalui`. SwiftUI: `.metalSelectionFrame(_:)` on the object, or `MetalSelectionFrame(size:)` for an overlay drawn apart from it. Sheet reference: the object sheet. There is no Base UI part: it is an object, and the host carries the selection semantics.

## Use it for

- Showing which object on a canvas or board is selected: a text block, an image, a card, a region, a file.
- The hover presence of a borderless object: faint corner dots so its invisible boundary is discoverable, and the edge light where the pointer enters its band.
- A multi-selection: `variant="lite"` on each member and one `SelectionFrame` around the bounding box with `count`.

## Don't use it for

- Selected rows, tabs, menu items or segments. They have their own selected state (a raised thumb, a pressed cap, a green bar).
- Keyboard focus. Focus is the 2 pt focus ring on `:focus-visible`; selection and focus can both show.
- A marquee while dragging. The marquee is a plain precision rectangle, drawn by the host.

## Anatomy

- **Ring**: 1.25 pt green-deep (green on graphite) at offset 6 from the object, so its radius is the object's plus 6 (a plate at 18 gets a ring at 24). A flat 3.5 pt collar `rgba(120,214,165,.16)` sits outside it: a band, never a blur.
- **Handles**: eight on the ring line. 10 pt round soft caps at the corners, 6 × 18 capsules at the edge midpoints. With `handles="text"` the n and s capsules are grips (grab cursor, move the object); the corners and e/w set the width. Each handle's hit area reaches 7 pt past its drawn shape.
- **Readout**: a graphite pill 24 tall, 16 under the object: a 4 pt green LED, then `W × H` in the readout role (Martian Mono 10.5, tabular), the `×` dimmed. It reads the measured frame, never a constant: `● 320 × 214`; `● 3 · 540 × 180` for a multi-selection; `● COPIED · PNG 130 × 215` for 900 ms after a copy.
- **Hover**: only the four corner dots, 5 pt, where the handles will be; the edge light (1.5 pt, fading at both ends) on the band edge under the pointer.

## States and motion

| State | What shows | Motion |
|---|---|---|
| rest | nothing | – |
| hover | corner dots; edge light on one edge | fade on settle |
| selected | ring, collar, handles, readout | ring and handles enter from 1.02 on the part spring, once |
| selected · writing | the same; readout at .78 | re-measures in the same frame as each keystroke; never replays its entrance |
| selected · moving | readout at 1 | – |
| lite | a 1 pt quiet ring, no collar, no handles | none |

Reduce Motion: part resolves instant, so the ring appears without its entrance; the dots and readout still fade (settle crossfades).

## API

| React prop | SwiftUI | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `state` | first argument | `rest`, `hover`, `selected` | `rest` |
| `variant` | `variant:` | `ring`, `lite` | `ring` |
| `mode` | `mode:` | `idle`, `writing`, `moving` | `idle` |
| `radius` | `radius:` | the object's corner radius | `0` |
| `handles` | `handles:` | `object`, `text`, `none` | `object` |
| `readout` | `readout:` | boolean | `true` |
| `count` | `count:` | blocks in a multi-selection | – |
| `size` | (the view's own frame) | `{ width, height }` to override the measured box | measured |
| `copied` | `copied:` | a format, e.g. `"PNG"` | – |
| `edge` | `edge:` | `n`, `e`, `s`, `w` | – |
| `onHandlePointerDown(handle, event)` | `onHandleDrag:` | the host resizes or moves the object | – |

```tsx
import { SelectionFrame } from '@unlocalhosted/metalui';

<div className="block" style={{ position: 'relative', borderRadius: 18 }} aria-selected={selected}>
  {text}
  <SelectionFrame state={selected ? 'selected' : hovered ? 'hover' : 'rest'} radius={18} handles="text" mode={editing ? 'writing' : 'idle'} />
</div>
```

```swift
import MetalUI

note
    .metalSelectionFrame(isSelected ? .selected : isHovered ? .hover : .rest, radius: MetalRadius.plate, handles: .text)
    .accessibilityAddTraits(isSelected ? .isSelected : [])
```

## Rules

- One selection for every kind: never restyle the ring per object type. For a borderless object the ring and dots are its boundary.
- The readout reads the measured frame (fractional layout size, rounded for display). Never type a size into it.
- A selection made by finishing (⎋, ⌘↩) is quiet: ring and readout, no tool strip. A click selection raises the tool strip.
- Handles sit on the ring line, not on the object's edge. Their hit area is larger than their drawing.
- Hover never changes layout: the dots and the edge light are overlays.

## Accessibility

- The frame is decoration (`aria-hidden`). The object carries the semantics: `aria-selected` (web) or `.isSelected` (SwiftUI) while selected, and its own label.
- Keyboard: arrows nudge the selection (1 pt, ⇧ 10 pt) and are the host's; the handles are pointer affordances with titles.
- Increase Contrast: the lite ring becomes the full-weight ring.
- Colour is never the only cue: the ring's shape and handles carry the state in both colorways.

## Tokens

`--mu-presence-*` (ring, collar, lite, handle, capsule, grip, readout, hover dot, edge light), `--mu-presence-dot` per colorway, `--mu-select-offset`, `--mu-led-green`, `--mu-led-ring`, `--mu-spring-part`, `--mu-spring-settle`. Swift: `MetalPresence`, `MetalRing.selectOffset`, `MetalTokens.<colorway>.presenceDot`.
